# QUANTILE-REGRESSION-BASED-LSTM-MODEL
Quantile Regression based Long-Short Term Memory Model
## Project Overview
With a six-year (2019--2024) dataset of AQI values from four metropolitan cities Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, the project compares the models under a rolling window setup. The major processes are data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using statistical tests like Dynamic Quantile (DQ) and Unconditional Calibration (UC).

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The dataset has been cleaned and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
- **Feature Selection:** 
- **Analysis:** In-depth analyses of customer demographics, feedback patterns, and resource utilization to provide actionable insights.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Users can interact with the dashboards in Power BI to explore the data dynamically, enabling drill-downs into specific areas of interest and providing a customized user experience.
